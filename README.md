- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **API Integration:** CoinGecko API

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

## Key Components

### ConnectWallet Component (`components/ConnectWallet.js`)

Handles MetaMask wallet integration:
- Detects MetaMask installation
- Connects to user's wallet
- Displays connected address and network
- Listens for account and network changes
- Shows installation prompt if MetaMask is not detected

### EthPriceToggle Component (`components/EthPriceToggle.js`)

Fetches and displays Ethereum price:
- Calls CoinGecko API for live ETH-USD price
- Displays price in a Bootstrap alert
- Handles loading states and errors
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds

### API Route (`pages/api/crypto/address.js`)

Server-side API endpoint:
- Returns recipient wallet address from environment variables
- Validates the address format
- Returns 500 error if not configured
- Ensures address is never exposed in client code

## Testing Checklist

Follow these steps to verify all functionality:

### 1. Initial Setup
- [ ] Run `npm install` successfully
- [ ] Create `.env.local` with valid `RECIPIENT_WALLET` address
- [ ] Start dev server with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. MetaMask Detection
- [ ] With MetaMask installed: "Connect Wallet" button appears
- [ ] Without MetaMask: Warning message with install link appears

### 3. Wallet Connection
- [ ] Click "Connect Wallet" button
- [ ] MetaMask popup appears requesting permission
- [ ] After approval, connected address displays
- [ ] Green "Connected" badge appears
- [ ] Current network name displays correctly

### 4. Account Change Detection
- [ ] Open MetaMask and switch to a different account
- [ ] UI automatically updates to show new account address
- [ ] No page reload required

### 5. Network Change Detection
- [ ] Switch networks in MetaMask (e.g., Mainnet to Sepolia)
- [ ] Page reloads automatically
- [ ] New network name displays after reload

### 6. ETH Price Fetching
- [ ] Click "Today's ETH Price" button
- [ ] Loading spinner appears
- [ ] Price displays in green with $ prefix
- [ ] Price formatted to 2 decimal places
- [ ] Alert auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- [ ] Last fetched price remains visible

### 7. Price Error Handling
- [ ] Disconnect internet (or block CoinGecko API)
- [ ] Click "Today's ETH Price"
- [ ] Error message displays in red alert

### 8. Recipient Address Display
- [ ] Recipient address loads on page load
- [ ] Address displays in monospace font
- [ ] "Copy" button appears next to address
- [ ] Click copy button - shows "Copied!" confirmation
- [ ] Address is copied to clipboard

### 9. Environment Variable Validation
- [ ] Remove or comment out `RECIPIENT_WALLET` in `.env.local`
- [ ] Restart dev server
- [ ] Error message appears in recipient section
- [ ] Error mentions missing `.env.local` configuration

### 10. Responsive Design
- [ ] Test on desktop - full address visible
- [ ] Test on mobile - shortened address visible
- [ ] All buttons and cards responsive
- [ ] Bootstrap components render correctly

## Environment Variables

### Server-Side Variables (`.env.local`)

| Variable | Description | Required | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `RECIPIENT_WALLET` | Ethereum address to receive payments | Yes | `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb` |

⚠️ **Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- The recipient address is only accessible via the API route
- Client-side code never has direct access to environment variables

## MetaMask Requirements

- **Browser Extension:** MetaMask must be installed in your browser
- **Network:** Works on any Ethereum network (Mainnet, Sepolia, Goerli, etc.)
- **HTTPS/Localhost:** MetaMask only works on HTTPS sites or localhost
- **Permissions:** User must approve wallet connection

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/crypto/address`

Returns the recipient wallet address.

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
}
```

**Response (Error - Not Configured):**
```json
{
  "error": "RECIPIENT_WALLET not configured",
  "message": "Please set RECIPIENT_WALLET in your .env.local file"
}
```

**Response (Error - Invalid Format):**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid RECIPIENT_WALLET format",
  "message": "RECIPIENT_WALLET must be a valid Ethereum address"
}
```

## External APIs Used

### CoinGecko API
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ethereum&vs_currencies=usd`
- **Purpose:** Fetch current ETH price in USD
- **Rate Limit:** Free tier allows ~10-50 calls/minute
- **No API Key Required**

## Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Not Detected
- Ensure MetaMask extension is installed and enabled
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Wallet Won't Connect
- Make sure you approve the connection in MetaMask popup
- Check if MetaMask is locked - unlock it first
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### Price Not Loading
- Check internet connection
- Verify CoinGecko API is accessible
- Check browser console for CORS or network errors

### Recipient Address Error
- Verify `.env.local` file exists in project root
- Ensure `RECIPIENT_WALLET` is set with valid Ethereum address
- Restart the development server after changing `.env.local`

### Page Doesn't Load
- Ensure you're accessing `http://localhost:3000` (not `https`)
- Check that port 3000 is not in use by another application
- Clear browser cache and try again

## Development Notes

### Code Organization
- Components are modular and reusable
- API routes follow Next.js conventions
- Environment variables are server-side only
- Bootstrap classes used throughout for consistency

### Best Practices Implemented
- Error handling on all async operations
- Loading states for better UX
- Input validation on API routes
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- Clean code with comments
- Security-first approach for wallet addresses

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- [ ] Transaction history tracking
- [ ] Multiple cryptocurrency support (BTC, USDT, etc.)
- [ ] QR code generation for wallet addresses
- [ ] Transaction amount input and gas estimation
- [ ] ENS (Ethereum Name Service) resolution
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
